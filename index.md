My name is Zoheb Shujauddin.  I'm a self-taught graphics programmer and game developer.

Over the course of my career Iâ€™ve worked in various tech-related fields including product support in virtualized environments, backend web-development, and game-engine development.

Outside of work, I enjoy working on personal programming projects, playing classical guitar, learning Kannada, and playing video games.
